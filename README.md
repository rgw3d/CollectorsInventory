Collector's Inventory
===================

Simple-ish app designed to categorize stuff. For my CS class

Has the layout of Items and Lists.  Lists can contain either Lists or Items, and Items contain only details. 
This would provide the frame work (along with the ability to add/modify this data) for someone to categorize
their collection.
